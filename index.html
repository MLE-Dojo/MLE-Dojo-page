          <p>
            We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically training, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM) agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. 
Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback loops. 
Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges (\eg, tabular data analysis, computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting). MLE-Dojo covers diverse, open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, and code debugging.
Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time outcome verification. 
Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. 
Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility.          </p>

    </div>
    <h2 class="title">Key Features</h2>
    <h3 class="title">Overview</h3>
    <p>
    <code>\method</code> provides a unified, Gym-style framework for training and evaluating LLM-based MLE agents in realistic, iterative ML engineering environments. It formalizes interactions as POMDPs and supports structured feedback through code execution, observation, and reward signals.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Modular and User-Friendly Interface</h3>
    <p>
    The environment is composed of modular components—<code>Error</code>, <code>Interface</code>, <code>Feedback</code>, and <code>Metric</code>—that are fully decoupled and extensible via a clean registration API. A single <code>env.step</code> call enables seamless agent-environment interaction, simplifying agent design and integration.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Extensible Task Space</h3>
    <p>
    All tasks are isolated in reproducible Docker containers with configurable execution sandboxes. A unified data format standardizes integration, allowing users to add custom competitions with minimal effort, ensuring compatibility and secure agent testing.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Observation Space</h3>
    <p>
    Each environment provides rich, structured observations, including competition context, evaluation metrics, code execution results, detailed error messages, and both agent- and environment-side interaction histories. This empowers agents with full situational awareness.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Expandable Action Space</h3>
    <p>
    <code>\method</code> supports five core actions—<code>request_info</code>, <code>validate_code</code>, <code>execute_code</code>, <code>get_history</code>, and <code>reset</code>—and allows users to register new actions through a customizable portal, enabling advanced experimentation and behavior design.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Reward Space and Environmental Feedback</h3>
    <p>
    Instead of coarse-grained medals, <code>\method</code> uses the <strong>HumanRank Score</strong>, a normalized leaderboard-based reward that reflects how well agents perform compared to human participants. This enables unified, fine-grained evaluation across diverse competitions.
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">Experiments</h2>
    We evaluate 8 mainstream LLMs as MLE Agents on 50 MLE-Dojo Evaluation tasks, which covers Tabular, NLP, CV, Time Series and so on.
    To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we consider Area Under the Performance Profile (AUP), HumanRank Score (H-Rank, %), and Elo ranking together as metrics. 
    We actively maintain a long-term real-time leaderboard to foster community-driven innovation.<ul>
    <h3 class="title">Main Results</h3>
    Reasoning and coding models such as <code>o3-mini</code>, <code>DeepSeek-r1</code>, and <code>Gemini-2.5-Pro</code> 
  consistently achieve high rankings across all metrics, demonstrating strong adaptability, robustness, and overall effectiveness as MLE Agents.
    <img src="static/images/scp/table.png" alt="MY ALT TEXT">
    <h3 class="title">Difficulty</h3>
    We define the difficulty level of different tasks with the average performance of different
models in comparison with the human leaderboard. As shown in the figure, CV tasks are the most
challenging-none of them have an average HumanRank score above 60, and more than half fall below
30. For MLE-Lite tasks, the average HumanRank scores mostly exceed 30. Difficulty levels of tasks
in other domains are more evenly distributed. 
      <br><br>
      <img src="static/images/scp/difficulty.jpg" alt="MY ALT TEXT">
    <h3 class="title">Cost v.s. Performance</h3>
    Figure below illustrates the cost-performance relationship across different LLMs and task categories.

    Reasoning models (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>DeepSeek-r1</code>) typically incur higher costs due to their premium pricing structures and longer solution outputs.

    Even reasoning models with comparatively lower pricing, such as <code>o3-mini</code>, tend to produce longer outputs due to more complex reasoning processes. These longer outputs significantly increase overall token consumption, contributing to higher cumulative costs.

    Notably, tasks involving computer vision and deep neural network training pipelines consistently generate longer codes compared to classical ML tasks (<em>e.g.</em>, tabular analysis) executed on CPUs.

    While cost generally correlates with solution complexity and token consumption, some models, such as <code>DeepSeek-r1</code>, achieve competitive performance with significantly fewer tokens, highlighting potential cost-efficiency opportunities.
    <div style="height: 1.5em;"></div>
    <img src="static/images/scp/cost.jpg" alt="MY ALT TEXT">
    <h3 class="title">Step-wise Performance Dynamics</h3>
    Figure below presents the step-wise performance improvements across different models, illustrating variations in performance 
    trajectories between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Among reasoning models, <code>o3-mini</code> consistently achieves high 
    performance within the initial steps (typically within the first five) and maintains stable scores in subsequent steps. Conversely, 
    <code>DeepSeek-r1</code> and <code>Gemini-2.5-Pro</code> exhibit gradual improvements, achieving comparable or superior performance 
    in intermediate to later steps. Non-reasoning models occasionally outperform reasoning models at early or intermediate steps but 
    generally show limited improvement as steps progress, resulting in lower final scores.
    <div style="height: 1.5em;"></div>
    <img src="static/images/scp/improve.jpg" alt="MY ALT TEXT">
    <h3 class="title">History Length and Solution Length</h3>
    Figure below shows both the total chat history length, including all interaction prompts, 
    actions, and generated codes, and the length of the best solution generated by each model. 
    The total chat history length closely aligns with the best solution length, where both metrics 
    positively correlate with overall model performance. Reasoning models typically generate notably 
    longer solutions compared to non-reasoning models. Moreover, stronger-performing models frequently 
    produce more extended solutions, which often correspond to higher performance scores. Although 
    increased solution length does not inherently ensure superior outcomes, it generally indicates a 
    model's capability to explore more intricate and sophisticated solution strategies, a hallmark 
    predominantly observed in more capable reasoning models.

    <h2 class="title">Develop with MLE-Dojo</h2>

    <h3>Interface and APIs</h3>
    <p>
      We provide 
      <a href="https://github.com/MLE-Dojo/MLE-Dojo/example/example.ipynb" target="_blank">
        quick examples
      </a>
      of APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      MLE-Dojo provides flexible Gym-style APIs that allow users to build personalized environments,
      introduce new datasets, and develop/utilize different agent scaffolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, <code>mledojo</code> serves as a powerful and flexible toolkit for interacting with machine
      learning competitions, designed for ease of use and extensibility. Its core components offer a seamless development experience:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong><code>Interface</code></strong>: Provides the primary way to interact with a competition. It manages distinct sub-interfaces for specific tasks:
        <ul>
          <li><code>InfoInterface</code>: Fetches competition details (overview, data structure, etc.).</li>
          <li><code>CodeValidationInterface</code>: Performs <strong>safe, preliminary checks</strong> on user code syntax and basic runtime behavior within a sandbox.</li>
          <li><code>CodeExecutionInterface</code>: Manages the <strong>full execution of user code</strong> within the sandbox, handles submission generation, and triggers evaluation.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: The <code>Interface</code> is <strong>modular</strong>, allowing developers to easily <strong>register custom interaction components</strong> tailored to specific needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>Sandbox</code></strong>: Ensures <strong>secure and fair code execution</strong> by running user scripts in an isolated environment with <strong>configurable resource limits</strong> (GPU, memory, time).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>FeedbackManager</code></strong>: Processes the results from validation and execution, generating <strong>structured and informative feedback</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: Designed to be extensible, allowing the <strong>registration of custom feedback providers</strong> (e.g., LLM-based analysis, specific error pattern detection) alongside the default <code>BaseFeedback</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><code>KaggleEnvironment</code></strong>: The main entry point, wrapping all components into a <strong>standardized, Gymnasium-compatible environment</strong>.
        It orchestrates the entire workflow (setup, action handling via <code>step</code>, state tracking, feedback generation),
        providing a consistent API for users or automated agents.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      MLE-Dojo combines well-defined interfaces, secure execution, structured feedback, and centralized management within a familiar Gym-style environment.
      Its <strong>modular and extensible design</strong> grants developers significant flexibility to adapt and build upon the core framework.
    </p>

    <h3>Collect trajectories for training</h3>
    <p>
      MLE-Dojo provides a detailed history management system and a well-defined reward feedback mechanism,
      including both final outcome rewards and intermediate step rewards.
      This design enables flexible use for model training via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL).
